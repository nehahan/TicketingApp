removed and checked- they are not required. All the links and pages working well.
Incorporated the following-
- Unique username, added unique index to the column "username" in the database "registraties" in table "reg_medew".This gives SQL error 1062. This is checked in "functions.php" and corresponding error is displayed. Also works for create_user.php (used by admin only)
- Focus/Cursor on the first field on login page. "login.php"
- Name displayed on the landing page. "header.php"
Modal Form- 
- Removed current time that was displayed in the modal form.
- Removed extra buttons from the modal. Now only 1 button is used to save the data in the database.
- Cancel and close buttons work. BUT!
- bug- step1-Form opened-> step2-data changed or added new info-> step3-form closed -> step4-form opened again >> The data from step 2 is displayed even though it is not yet saved in the database.

7th version-
- Focus on the first field of the register user page. "register.php"
- Focus on the first field of the register admin page. "create_user.php"
- Name field added. "register.php", "create_user.php", "functions.php"
- Username uniqueness incorparated completely and checked! Working!
- Cancel and close buttons reset the form.(bug from version 6)
- Checked Update registratie button thoroughly.It updates the database when clicked.(Already incorporated in ver 6 ,I think!)

8th version-
- Made cancel changes button as just Cancel and closes the modal.
- Admin/User control inside modal
- bug- When admin is logged in, the form reset() does not work. It works fine when user is logged in.


9th version
-logic for closing the modal and resetting the form- link : 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33477930/close-bootstrap-modal-on-form-submit
It works!!

10th version-major changes made-
before- 
- login page --> index_1 (main landing page) --> tabs opened lijst_reg_norm( this file is included using php method include()) This also filled the forms in the background **1--> clicking on a reg_ID would open a prefilled form that included the modal for that reg_ID 
**1 problem with this was with any event related to reloading the list , it increased the reloading time. It slowed the process.
so now- 
- login page --> index_1 (main landing page) --> tabs opened lijst_reg_norm( this file is included using php method include()) -->
clicking on a reg_ID would open a prefilled form ( this opens a modal and then loads the form using registraties.php).The red_ID is passed using data attribute using data-href.Using $_GET['reg_ID] we capture this number and then load the data to the form that is loaded when modal opens.**2
**2 With these changes made now, the cancel buttons work fine the form is loaded fine. But the update of the data is not working. 
I think, the problem is when the modal is closed so is the file that contains the logic to submit the data. I am not sure though. This problem is out of the blue now. 

- The field associated to Medewerker BIO changed. It has a drop down list of the users + admins and is updated in a NEW column- td_new in the reg_storing table of registraties database.( table : reg_storing, database : registraties ,user : root, password : Sb1234#) 

11th version -
- removed the files created for testing purposes.
- header.php and footer.php files removed, the code was very small and hence copied it in index_1.php
- removed folder C:\wamp64\www\Sb_ver11\Connections.
- new file updatecode.php for updating the changed data in the form into the database

12th version -
- submit buttons on 2 different forms- thre reg-ID and new registrations are working .
- sorting is faster
- functionality is good.

13th version-
- removed C:\wamp64\www\registraties\img folder
- All the links to forms are opening when the respective buttons are clicked.
New registratie, update registratie; 
new Alarm melding, update alarm melding; 
new medewerker, update medewerker; 
new bedrijf, update bedrijf; log out; 
list jobs assigned to logged in user/admin; 
list of jobs not assigned to anyone ; 
list of 'afgehandled' jobs.
- If the page is closed , on opening a new browser or tab, the user is not prompted to log in first but is getting access to previously opened pages , if not logged out .

14th version-
bug solved-
bug - on submitting any form( registratie, alarm, medewerker or bedrijf) the landing page used to be loaded. This was happening because, even though the index_1.php was loaded, the $_GET['page'] variable was lost. Hence had to find an alternative to this issue.
Now, the respective pages are loaded,the solution was found on -
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33483960/how-to-reload-a-page-on-submit
still, the new- alarm form on submitting loads the landing page. The problem got solved when I canged the path to the file that contained the form.
Whohoo!! The project is over!!
functions.php updated.
